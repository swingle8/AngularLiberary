<b>The Ask</b>
<ol>
<li> Add a new field to the model called author
<li> Add a new field to the model called file size
<li> Add a new field to the model called creation date
<!--
1. For Ask 1,2 and 3 : Edit constructor Project add fields author,filesize and date in Projects.js.

2. For Ask 1,2 and 3 : In the List Controller , add itm.author,itm.filesize,itm.date fields in the oject of Project before display.

3. For Ask 1,2 and 3 : In EditCtrl , As we needed to save newly created attributes , created prj.author, prj.filesize, prj.date here in save function. 
-->


<li> Make the column headings clickable and clicking them should cycle
through sorting by ascending, descending and no order
<!--
1. For Ask 4 : Edit <th> tag of <table> make them clickable in list.html.
   
2. For Ask 4 : develop 3 variables in List controller of Project.js , field, reverse and count
   
3. For Ask 4 : develop a function called order in List controller of Project.js , which takes the column name 
               which is being pressed and calculate from count variable what kind of sort it has to perform on
			   data and set field , reverse variables accordingly.
                   
4. For Ask 4 : field, reverse scope variables are then used in List.html for generate view accordingly. 
-->

<li> Add a search row below the heading row, each column contains a search
field. Entering a value in the search field should filter data only based on
values in that column (unlike the search above the table which filters
based on data in any field)
<!--
1. For Ask 5 : create 5 input fields in list.html having ng-model like search.name,search.description,
               search.author,search.filesize, search.date.
   
2. For Ask 5 : Apply filter in ng-repeat on search
-->

<li> Add another action next to the pencil icon on each row to delete the
record
<!--
1. For Ask 6 : create one more column in the Table 'List.html' , on click it calls destroy funcion 
               in the List Controller.  
   
2. For Ask 6 : Develop a destroy function which calls remove() function of projects class passing it 
               the project id to be removed.
-->
</ol>
You must attempt one of the following two. For experienced developers interested in senior positions, both are required.
<ol>
<li> Add a cart area and provide the ability to drag and drop the libraries
into this cart. The cart should display each library as a cart item with
name and file size. Below the cart, the total file size should be
displayed.
<!--
1. For Ask 7 : Created custom Draggable and Droppable directives and implement Draggable in the 
               Data Div and droppable in the Cart div.   
   
2. For Ask 7 : Take return of data from droppable directive and call CreateCart function in the 
               project.js file and here make CartItem type object and add it in a array, and 
			   also removes the Project object from the projects array.
			   
3. For Ask 7 : In the CreateCart function , we are also calculating the file size in a Global
               variable.		   
-->

<li> Integrate with any charting/visualization library and present the data
either based on creation date or file size. Any other visualizations are
welcome
<!--
1. For Ask 8 : include FusionChart liberarys in the index.html file.

2. For Ask 8 : Create GenerateChart controller inthe project.js which is mapped with chart.html, 
               on which maps are loading.
